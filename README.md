# Web-Scraping-and-Data-Preprocessing
Developed a comprehensive and efficient data preprocessing for text data to enhance the performance of natural language processing (NLP) models. Preprocessing text data is a critical step in any NLP project. It involves cleaning, transforming, and structuring raw text into a format that models can interpret and learn from effectively. This project will cover a range of preprocessing techniques tailored to text data, addressing challenges like noise, inconsistency, and redundancy. Text data was collected using web scraping . Key Steps in Text Data Preprocessing: 1. Text Cleaning 2. Tokenization: 3. Normalization 4. Stop words Removal 5. Stemming and Lemmatization 6. Handling Contractions 7. Handling Emojis and Emoticons 8. Spell Checking
